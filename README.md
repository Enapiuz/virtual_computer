# Virtual Computer
Fun project to build virtual computer purely from logical blocks.

## Goal
- 8bit general purpose MISC CPU.
- Assembler for it.
- Wrap it in Electron to use Canvas as monitor (and make a GPU before this).
- Try to run existing small OS (by implementing proper assembler) or to write a simple one from scratch.
- Or at least to learn some new stuff I missed in university.
