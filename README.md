# Virtual Computer

Fun project to build a virtual computer purely from logical blocks.

## Goal

-   8bit (or 16, maybe) general purpose MISC CPU.
-   Assembler for it.
-   Wrap it in Electron to use Canvas as a monitor (and make a stupid GPU before this, maybe not properly emulated).
-   Try to run existing small OS (by implementing proper assembler) or to write a simple one from scratch.
-   Or at least to learn some new stuff I missed in university.

## Compile

`yarn compile:watch`

## Run

`yarn start` â€” will run vm under nodemon
